# ISLR-python-Implementation
This repository contains Python code for a selection of tables, figures and LAB sections from the book <A target="_blank" href='http://www-bcf.usc.edu/%7Egareth/ISL/index.html'>'An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R'</A> by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2013).<P>


This great book gives a thorough introduction to the field of Statistical/Machine Learning. The book is available for download (see link below), but I think this is one of those books that is definitely worth buying. The book contains sections with applications in R based on public datasets available for download or which are part of the <A target="_blank" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ISLR/index.html">R-package ISLR</A>. Furthermore, there is a Stanford University online course based on this book and taught by the authors (See <A target="_blank" href='https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/'>course catalogue</A> for current schedule).<P>
Since Python is my language of choice for data analysis, I decided to try and do some of the calculations and plots in Jupyter Notebooks using:

 - pandas
 - numpy
 - scipy
 - scikit-learn
 - python-glmnet
 - statsmodels
 - patsy
 - matplotlib
 - seaborn

It was a good way to learn more about Machine Learning in Python by creating these notebooks. I created some of the figures/tables of the chapters and worked through some LAB sections. At certain points I realize that it may look like I tried too hard to make the output identical to the tables and R-plots in the book. But I did this to explore some details of the libraries mentioned above (mostly matplotlib and seaborn). Note that this repository is <STRONG>not a standalone tutorial</STRONG> and that you probably should have a copy of the book to follow along. Suggestions for improvement and help with unsolved issues are welcome!
See Hastie et al. (2009) for an advanced treatment of these topics.<P>
